# ParallelRadixSortCUDA
CUDA implementation of parallel radix sort.
- I was a bit inpired with this article [paper by Ha, Kr√ºger, and Silva](https://vgc.poly.edu/~csilva/papers/cgf.pdf) to produce my implementation of  radix sort.
- 1 bit per pass
- 2 bits per pass, resulting in 4-way split each pass.
